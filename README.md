# Telegram easy vpn admin

This is simple bot to manage clients from [wg-easy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy) with telegram. Currently it expects only one person - an admin and uses undocumented REST API.

## How to run your own bot

1. Register new bot using [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#creating-a-new-bot) and save api token somewhere.
2. Run wg-easy with docker or docker compose. Make sure to open dashboard port(51821 TCP by default) to your bot.
3. Provide these environment variables before run. You can add `export` to .bashrc or configure IDE.

    ```bash
    TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=token from botfather
    TELEGRAM_USERNAME=case sensetive telegram username without@
    VPN_ADMIN_URL=http://<host>:<port>/
    VPN_ADMIN_PASSWORD=ðŸš¨YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD
    ```

4. Start bot `go run main.go`.
